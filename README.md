I am a postdoctoral research associate in the [Division of Applied Mathematics](https://appliedmath.brown.edu/) at Brown University. Before coming to Brown, I obtained my Ph.D. from the [Department of Electrical Communication Engineering](https://ece.iisc.ac.in/) at the [Indian Institute of Science](https://iisc.ac.in/), Bengaluru, India.

I am broadly interested in applied probability. My current research aims to understand the behavior of interacting particle systems on sparse graphs. My Ph.D. research focused on the study of large-time behavior and metastability in models of mean-field interacting particle systems, with applications to communication networks.
